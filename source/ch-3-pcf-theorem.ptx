  <title>The theory of exact upper bounds</title>

  <introduction>
  <p>
	  This chapter is focused on a general question: under what circumstances will a <m>&lt;_I</m>-increasing sequence have an exact upper bound?
      We already have one answer to this question: such a sequence will have an exact upper bound if and only if it is equivalent modulo <m>I</m>
       to a product <m>(\prod f, \leq_I)</m> for some function~<m>f</m>.  This answer is not a very satisfying one, though, because it is just a manipulation of these
        definitions we have made.  Our goal in this chapter is to obtain a real answer to this question, with an eye towards developing internal criteria that can be
         applied to sequences to detect when a suitable <m>f</m> must exist.
