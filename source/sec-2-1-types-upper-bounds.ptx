			<title>Basic Definitions</title>

		<p>
			We start our project by looking at how exact upper bounds compare to other natural candidates for being a <q>smallest</q> upper bound modulo <m>I</m> for a collection of functions <m>F</m>. We gather a few of these possibilities in the next definition.

		<definition xml:id="def-three-bounds">

						Suppose <m>F\subseteq \On^A</m> is a set of functions, and <m>f</m> is an upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>.

					   <li>
								   <p>
									   (<xref ref="def-eub"/>) We say <m>f</m> is an <em>exact upper bound</em> for <m>F</m> if for any <m>g&lt;_I f</m> there is an <m>h\in F</m> with <m>g\leq_I h</m>. We say that <m>f</m> is an <em>eub for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m></em>.

			</statement>

		<p>
			Note that these three conditions all coincide when <m>I</m> is a maximal proper ideal on <m>A</m>, 
			and it should be clear that a least upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m> is also a minimal upper bound. 
			In the circumstances of most interest to us, an exact upper bound will also be a least upper bound, as shown by the following claim.
		</p>

		<proposition xml:id="prop-eub-vs-lub">
			<statement>
				<p>
				If <m>F</m> is non-empty and <m>&lt;_I</m>-directed, then an exact upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m> is also a least upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</proposition>
		<proof>
			<p>
				 Suppose that <m>f</m> is an exact upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>, and <m>g</m> is any other upper bound. We need to show <m>f\leq_I g</m> holds.
			</p>

			<p>
				By replacing <m>g</m> with <m>\min\{f, g\}</m> if necessary, we may assume that <m>f\leq g</m>. Now suppose that <m>f\nleq_I g</m>, so that there is an <m>I</m>-positive set of <m>a\in A</m> with <m>g(a)&lt;f(a)</m>. Let <m>g'</m> be the function in <m>\prod f</m> that agrees with <m>g</m> at any <m>a</m> for which <m>g(a)</m> is less than <m>f(a)</m>, and which takes on the value <m>0</m> otherwise. Since we assumed that <m>F</m> is <m>&lt;_I</m>-directed, it follows that <m>f(a)</m> must be non-zero almost everywhere and therefore <m>g'&lt;_I f</m>. Since <m>f</m> is an exact upper bound for <m>F</m>, this means there must be an <m>h\in F</m> such that <m>g'\leq_I h</m>, and since <m>F</m> is <m>&lt;_I</m>-directed, we may assume that <m>g'&lt;_I h</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we have a problem. On one hand, we know <m>g'(a)&lt;h(a)</m> for almost every <m>a\in A</m>, and we know <m>h(a)\leq g(a)</m> for almost every <m>a\in A</m> (as <m>g</m> is an upper bound for <m>f</m>). On the other hand, <m>g'(a)=g(a)</m> on an <m>I</m>-positive set by our construction. Thus, there must be an <m>a\in A</m> for which <m>g(a)=g'(a)&lt;h(a)&lt;g(a)</m>, and this is a contradiction. ◻
			</p>
		</proof>


		<p>
				Some assumption like the above is necessary to conclude that an exact upper bound is a least upper bound: see Exercise <xref ref="exer:eubnotlub" /> below. These varieties of upper bounds do, however, all interact with the equivalence relations <m>=_I</m> and <m>\equiv_I</m> in the way we might wish.

		<p>
			Sometimes it is helpful to view these concepts in their contrapositive formulations. 
			If <m>f</m> is a minimal upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>, then any function that is almost everywhere
			 strictly less than <m>f</m> will fail to bound <m>F</m>. If <m>f</m> is a least upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>,
			  then any function that is strictly less than <m>f</m> on an <m>I</m>-positive set will fail to bound <m>F</m>. 
			  Finally, any function that is almost everywhere strictly less than an exact upper bound <m>f</m> is actually bounded by some member
			   of <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>. In a similar vein, we can characterize the concepts from <xref ref="def-three-bounds" /> for <m>F\subseteq\prod f</m> by the way in which <m>F</m> sits inside of <m>\prod f</m>.

			</statement>
		</theorem>
		<proof>
			<p>
				<em>Proof.</em> Statement (1) and (3) are very easy, and follow directly from the corresponding definitions. For (2), suppose first that there is an <m>I</m>-positive <m>B\subseteq A</m> and a function <m>h\in\prod f</m> such that <m>h</m> bounds <m>F</m> modulo the ideal <m>I\restriction B</m>. Define a function <m>g</m> with domain <m>A</m> by <me>g(a)=
\begin{cases}
h(a)   &amp;\text{if $a\in B$, and}\\
f(a)   &amp;\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}</me> The function <m>g</m> is an upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>, and since <m>\neg f\leq_I g</m> it follows that <m>f</m> is not a least upper bound for <m>F</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				If on the other hand <m>f</m> is not a least upper bound for <m>F\subseteq\prod f</m>, then there will be a witnessing function <m>g</m>, and we can take <me>B:=&lt;(g, f)=\{a\in A: g(a)&lt;f(a)\}.</me> The set <m>B</m> is <m>I</m>-positive (as <m>g</m> and <m>f</m> are not equal modulo <m>I</m>), and <m>g</m> bounds <m>F</m> modulo <m>I\restriction B</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				As for (4), note that if <m>F</m> is <m>\leq_I</m>-cofinal in <m>\prod f</m> then this will remain true in <m>(\prod f, \leq_J)</m> for any ideal <m>J</m> on <m>A</m> that extends <m>I</m>. If <m>F</m> is NOT <m>\leq_I</m>-cofinal in <m>\prod f</m> then this will be witnessed by a function <m>h\in\prod f</m> such that <m>h</m> is not bounded by any <m>g\in F</m>. Let <m>J</m> be the ideal on <m>A</m> generated by <m>I</m> together with the sets <m>&lt;(h, g)</m> for <m>g\in F</m>. It is clear that <m>F</m> will be <m>\leq_J</m>-bounded by <m>h</m>, so we finish if we show that <m>J</m> is in fact a proper ideal.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose by way of contradiction that this fails. This means that there are finitely many functions <m>\{g_i:i&lt;n\}</m> in <m>F</m> and a set <m>X\in I</m> such that <me>A = X \cup \bigcup_{i&lt;n}&lt;(h, g_i).</me> Translating this into quantifiers, what we have is a function <m>h\in\prod f</m> such that 
				<men xml:id="eqn-rando">
					(\forall^I i\in A)(\exists i&lt; n)\left[h(a)&lt;g_i(a)\right]	
				</men>
				We have assumed that <m>F</m> is <m>\leq_I</m>-directed, so there is a single <m>g\in F</m> such that <m>g_i\leq_I g</m> for all <m>i&lt;n</m>. But then <xref ref="eqn-rando" /> implies that <m>h&lt;_I g</m> and this contradicts the choice of <m>h</m>. Thus <m>J</m> is a proper ideal on <m>A</m>, and <m>h</m> witnesses that <m>F</m> is <m>\leq_J</m>-bounded in <m>\prod f</m>. ◻

							   </p>
				   </li>
   
			   </ol></p>
			</statement>
		</proposition>
		<proof>
			<p>
			Clause (1) is easy, as if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are upper bounds
			 for <m>\ov{f}</m> then so is the function <m>\min(f, g)</m>. Suppose now that <m>f</m> is a least upper bound for <m>\ov{f}</m> that is not exact. 
			 This means that <m>\ov{f}</m> fails to be cofinal in <m>(\prod f, &lt;_I)</m>, and so there is a function
			  <m>g\in\prod f</m> that witnesses this. We claim now that <m>g</m> has the required properties. 
			  It is obvious that sequence <m>\langle t_\alpha:\alpha&lt;\lambda\rangle</m> will be <m>\subseteq_I</m>-increasing because
			   <m>\ov{f}</m> is <m>&lt;_I</m>-increasing. Moreover, for each <m>\alpha&lt;\lambda</m> both <m>t_\alpha</m> and its complement must be
			    <m>I</m>-positive: <m>g</m> does not bound <m>\ov{f}</m> modulo <m>I</m>, nor does <m>\ov{f}</m> bound <m>g</m>.
				 If the sequence of sets <m>t_\alpha</m> were to eventually stabilize modulo <m>I</m>, say <m>t_\alpha =_I B</m> for all sufficiently large
				  <m>\alpha&lt;\lambda</m>, then we have a contradiction of part (2) of <xref ref="thm-three-characterizations" /> because <m>\ov{f}</m> is bounded by <m>g</m> on <m>A\setminus B</m>. ◻

		<p>
			The following corollary follows from (2) above by an easy argument which we relegate

			<title>Examples</title>

			<p>
				We finish this section with a few examples chosen to illustrate the definitions we have been investigating.
			</p>
			<example>
				<p>
					Let <m>A=\omega</m> and let <m>I</m> be the ideal <m>\Fin(\omega)</m> of finite subsets of <m>\omega</m>. For each <m>n&lt;\omega</m> let <m>f_n</m> be constant with value <m>n</m>, and let <m>F =\{f_n:n&lt;\omega\}</m>. If <m>g</m> is any <m>\leq_I</m>-upper bound for <m>F</m> in <m>\On^A</m>, the function <m>h</m> defined by <me>h(n) =
	\begin{cases}
	g(n)-1   &amp;\text{if $g(n)&gt;0$, and}\\
	0        &amp;\text{otherwise.}
	\end{cases}</me> is another upper bound for <m>F</m> with <m>h&lt;_I g</m>. Even though <m>F</m> is <m>\leq_I</m>-bounded in <m>\On^A</m>, it does not have a minimal upper bound. <m>\blacksquare</m>
				</p>
			</example>

		<example>
			<p>
				Continuing with <m>A</m> and <m>I</m> as in the previous example, let <m>f_\alpha</m> be constant with value <m>\alpha</m> for each <m>\alpha\leq\omega_1</m>. We claim that <m>g=f_{\omega_1}</m> is an exact upper bound for <m>F=\{f_\alpha:\alpha&lt;\omega_1\}</m> modulo <m>I</m>. Suppose <m>h&lt;_I g</m>, so <m>h(n)&lt;\omega_1</m> for all sufficiently large <m>n</m>. Since <m>|A|&lt;\cf(\omega_1)</m>, there is a single <m>\alpha&lt;\omega_1</m> such that <m>h(n)&lt;\alpha</m> for all sufficiently large <m>n</m>, hence <m>h&lt;_I f_\alpha</m> as required. <m>\blacksquare</m>
		   </p>
		</example>

		<example>
			<p>
				Let <m>A=\omega_1</m>, and for each <m>\alpha&lt;\omega_1</m> let <m>f_\alpha</m> be the function that is constant with value <m>\alpha</m> for <m>\alpha&lt;\omega_1</m>. Let <m>F=\{f_\alpha:\alpha&lt;\omega_1\}</m>, and let <m>g</m> be the identity function on <m>\omega_1</m>. What occurs modulo the ideal <m>I=J^\bd[A]</m> of bounded subsets of <m>A</m>? The function <m>g</m> is a minimal upper bound for <m>F</m> because any function <m>h\in\prod g</m> is bounded on a stationary (hence uncountable) set. On the other hand <m>g</m> is not a least upper bound bound for <m>F</m>: if <m>X</m> is the collection of countable successor ordinals, then the function <m>h</m> defined by <me>h(\alpha) = 
\begin{cases}
\beta  &amp;\text{if $\alpha=\beta+1$, and}\\
\alpha &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</me> sits below <m>g</m> on an <m>I</m>-positive set, but is still an upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>. <m>\blacksquare</m>
			</p>
		</example>

		<example>
			<p>
				What occurs in the previous example if we enlarge <m>I</m> to be the non-stationary ideal on <m>\omega_1</m>? The function <m>g</m> is now a least upper bound for <m>F</m> because of the normality of <m>I</m>: any function that is less than <m>g</m> on an <m>I</m>-positive set is constant on an <m>I</m>-positive set and therefore cannot be an upper bound for <m>F</m> modulo <m>I</m>. On the other hand, <m>g</m> is not an exact upper bound for <m>F</m>. To see this, let <m>\langle S_\alpha:\alpha&lt;\omega_1\rangle</m> partition <m>\omega_1</m> into disjoint stationary sets, and let <m>T_\alpha = S_\alpha\setminus \alpha+1</m>. Then each set <m>S_\alpha</m> is stationary, and we have arranged <m>\alpha&lt;\min(S_\alpha)</m>. Now define a function <m>h</m> with domain <m>A</m> by setting <me>h(\beta)=
\begin{cases}
\alpha &amp;\text{if $\beta\in S_\alpha$, and}\\
0      &amp;\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}</me> The function <m>h</m> is in <m>\prod g</m> (as <m>h(\beta)&lt;\beta</m> for all <m>\beta\in A</m>) but there is no <m>\alpha&lt;\omega_1</m> such that <m>h\leq_I f_\alpha</m>. <m>\blacksquare</m>
