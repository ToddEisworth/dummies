  <title><em>THE</em> argument</title>

  <p> Our goal in this section is to lay out some variants of the key
     argument that ties characteristic functions of models to their contents.</p>


<subsection xml:id="subsec-folklore">



  <title>The basic result</title>
  

  <p>
    Our usual assumption is that <m>\lambda</m> is a cardinal (singular in many of our applications), and <m>\chi </m> is a regular cardinal must larger than <m>\lambda</m>.  We let <m>\mathfrak{A}</m> denote
    the structure <m>\langle H(\chi), \in, \lt_\chi\rangle</m> where as usual <m>H(\chi)</m> denotes the sets hereditarily of cardinality less than <m>\chi </m> and <m>\lt_\chi</m> is some 
    fixed well-ordering of <m>H(\chi)</m> which is included to ensure that we have definable Skolem functions in the structure <m>\mathfrak{A}</m>.
  </p>


  <theorem xml:id="thm-the-argument">
    <statement>
      <p>
       Suppose <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> are elementary submodels of <m>\mathfrak{A}</m> containing <m>\lambda </m> such that <m>M\cap\theta</m> contains a cofinal subset of
        <m>N\cap\theta</m> for every regular cardinal <m>\theta\leq\lambda</m> in <m>M\cap N</m>.  Then <m>N\cap\lambda\subseteq M</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
     We can replace <m>M</m> by the smaller model <m>M\cap N</m> and the hypotheses will still hold, so we may as well assume that <m>M\subseteq N</m>.
      Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap\lambda\setminus M</m> is non-empty, and define
      <me>
        \alpha :=\min(N\cap\lambda\setminus M)
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \beta:=\min(M\setminus\alpha).
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that <m>\alpha\lt\beta\leq\lambda</m>, and furthermore
    <men xml:id="eqn-1">
      M\cap [\alpha,\beta)=\emptyset.
    </men>
    Since <m>M</m> is closed under the predecessor function, it follows that <m>\beta</m> is a limit ordinal. Since <m>\alpha\in N\cap\theta</m> it follows from <xref ref="eqn-1"/>
     that <m>M</m> does not contain a cofinal subset of <m>N\cap\beta</m>. Thus, our assumptions imply <m>\beta</m> cannot be a regular cardinal and therefore <m>\cf(\beta)\lt\beta</m>.  From another application
     of <xref ref="eqn-1"/> we conclude <m>\cf(\beta)\lt\alpha</m> and therefore
     <men xml:id="eqn-2">
      M\cap\cf(\beta)= N\cap\cf(\beta).
     </men>
    </p>
    <p>
    In the model <m>M</m> fix a strictly increasing function <m>f</m> mapping <m>\cf(\beta)</m> onto a cofinal subset of <m>\beta</m>.  Since <m>M\subseteq N</m> and <m>\alpha\lt\beta</m>
    there is a <m>\gamma\in N\cap\cf(\beta)</m> such that <m>\alpha\leq f(\gamma)\lt\beta</m>.  This ordinal <m>\gamma</m> must be in <m>M</m> by way of <xref ref="eqn-2"/>, and so <m>f(\gamma)</m>
    must be in <m>M</m> as well, contradicting <xref ref="eqn-1"/>.
