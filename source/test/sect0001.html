<h1 id="a0000000002">1 Introduction</h1>
<p> Rudin’s construction of a Dowker space in \(\zfc \) <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#rudin" >10</a>
	]
</span> is one of the most elegant constructions in set-theoretic topology. Rudin’s space, \(X^R\), is a subset of the product \(\prod _{0{\lt}n} (\aleph _n+1)\), with the topology inherited from the box topology on the full product. Its topological properties were established by Rudin via, somewhat surprisingly, typical PCF theory arguments — about twenty years before Shelah developed PCF theory. </p>
<p>Recently, A. Rinot asked if there was a proper class of Dowker spaces in \(\zfc \) alone, and, more specifically, whether replacing the sequence of \(\aleph _n\)-s in Rudin’s construction by the sequence of all finite successors, \(\mu ^{+n}\) for some positive natural number \(n\), of an arbitrary cardinal \(\mu \), can be proved in \(\zfc \) to always yields a Dowker space. </p>
<p>Below we answer Rinot’s questions positively, and more. A pcf-thoretic condition on an arbitrary increasing sequence \(\overline\kappa =\langle \kappa _n\mid n\in \omega \rangle \) of regular cardinals above a cardinal \(\mu \) is given and shown to imply that a generalization of Rudin’s construction on the sequence \(\overline\kappa \) produces a Dowker space. This condition holds in \(\zfc \) for all sequences \(\langle \mu ^{+n}\mid n\in \omega \rangle \) of all finite sucessors of every cardinal \(\mu \) and many more, arbitrarily sparse, sequences of regular cardinals. In addition, with the additional (consistent) axiom \(\ssh \), Shelah’s Strong Hypothesis, it holds that <em>all</em> increasing sequences \(\overline\kappa \) of regular cardinals satisfy this condition. Consequently, it is consistent with \(\zfc \) that Rudin’s construction produces a Dowker space with every substitution of \(\aleph _0\) by an arbirary cardinal \(\mu \) and of the sequence of \(\aleph _n\)-s by an increasig sequence of regular cardinals \(\overline\kappa \) above \(\mu \). </p>
<p>The question remains if \(\ssh \), or, for that matter, any additional axiom beyond \(\zfc \), is needed. A forcing construction for producing a sequence \(\overline\kappa \) for which the resulting Rudin-type space is not Dowker will have to produce sophisticated violations of the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis in the spirit of <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#gitik-shelah" >2</a>
	]
</span> and will necessarily use large cardinal axioms. </p>

<p>Rudin’s space was shown with PCF theory to contain a closed Dowker space of cardinality \(\aleph _{\omega +1}\) in \(\zfc \) <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#kojsh" >6</a>
	]
</span>, and Rudin-like subspaces of the Rudin space emerged in the analysis of Baire measures on this space (and their extensions to Borel measures) <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#kojmich" >4</a>
	]
</span>. Finally, further developments of the linearly Lindeloef, not Lindeloef property of Miscenko’s space <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#miscenko" >7</a>
	]
</span>, which was the direct inspiration for Rudin’s construction, with PCF techniques, was done in <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#kojlub" >5</a>
	]
</span>. An alternative example of a linearly Lindeloef non-Lindeloef space, which is also a topological group, was discovered independently by G. Gruenhage and R. Buzyakova, see <span class="cite">
