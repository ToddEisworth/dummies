		Suppose <m>A</m> is a non-empty set, and let <m>\On^A</m> be the class of ordinal-valued functions with domain <m>A</m>. This structure can be partially-ordered by comparing functions pointwise, setting <m>f\leq g</m> if and only if <m>f(a)\leq g(a)</m> for all <m>a\in A</m>. This is certainly a natural way to impose some organization on <m>\On^A</m>, but it is a bit intractable because such functions can intertwine in complicated ways and arbitrary functions in <m>\On^A</m> are unlikely to be comparable under the pointwise order.

			An ideal on <m>A</m> should be thought of as a collection of <q>negligible</q> or <q>small</q> subsets of <m>A</m>, while filters on <m>A</m> capture the dual notion of being <q>substantial</q> or <q>large</q>. This basic intuition motivates much of the way we think about these objects. In both definitions, the first requirement imposes a non-triviality condition: we ask that the collections are non-empty without containing every subset of <m>A</m>. On a few occasions, we may relax this condition and talk about the <em>improper ideal</em>, which corresponds to the degenerate case <m>I=\mathcal{P}(A)</m>, but we will warn the reader ahead of time. We will also formulate most of our discussion in terms of ideals, but keep in mind that almost everything can be stated in terms of filters as well.

		<p>
			We turn now to some basic vocabulary:
		</p>

<!-- div attr= class="definition"-->
		<p>
			Suppose <m>I</m> is an ideal on <m>A</m>.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
						The <em>domain of <m>I</m></em>, <m>\dom(I)</m>, is defined to be the set <m>\bigcup I</m>.
					</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
						We define <m>I^+</m>, the collection of <m>I</m>-positive subsets of <m>A</m> (or the <em>co-ideal determined by <m>I</m></em>), by <m>I^+=\mathcal{P}(A)\setminus I</m>.
					</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
						The filter dual to <m>I</m>, denoted <m>I^*</m>, is defined as <m>I^*=\{X\subseteq A: A\setminus X\in I\}</m>.
					</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
						If <m>X</m> is an <m>I</m>-positive subset of <m>A</m>, then we define <m>I\restr X</m>, the restriction of <m>I</m> to <m>X</m>, by <me>I\restr X = \{Y\subseteq A: X\cap Y\in I\}.</me>
					</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
						If <m>X</m> is a subset of <m>A</m> with <m>A\setminus X\in I^+</m>, then we define <m>I+X</m>, the extension of <m>I</m> by <m>X</m>, to be <me>I+X = I\restr (A\setminus X) = \{Y\subseteq A: X\setminus Y\in I\}</me>
					</p>
			</li>

		</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="definition">-->

		<p>
			We pause for a moment to examine how the preceding definition plays out in the context of some standard examples.
		</p>

<!-- div attr= class="example"-->
		<p>
			Our first example is a familar one: start with the set of natural numbers <m>\omega</m>, and take <m>I</m> to be the <em>Frechet ideal</em> <m>\Fin(\omega)</m> on <m>\omega</m> consisting of all finite sets of natural numbers. This satisfies the requirements for being an ideal with <m>\dom(I)=\omega</m>, and a subset of <m>\omega</m> is <m>I</m>-positive if and only if it is infinite. The corresponding dual filter <m>I^*</m> (also known as the <em>Frechet filter</em>) consists of all of the co-finite subsets of <m>\omega</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we take <m>X</m> to be the set of even numbers, then both <m>X</m> and its complement are <m>I</m>-positive so both <m>I\restr X</m> and <m>I+X</m> are also ideals on <m>\omega</m>. Note that a set is in <m>I\restr X</m> if and only if it contains only finitely many even numbers, and a set is in <m>I+X</m> if and only if contains only finitely many odd numbers.
		</p>

		<p>
			We could just as easily consider <m>I</m> to be an ideal on any set <m>A</m> containing <m>\omega</m>: <m>I</m> will still be a subset of <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m> satisfying the definition of an ideal. If <m>\omega</m> is a proper subset of <m>A</m>, then <m>I</m> will be a proper subset of <m>\Fin(A)</m>, the ideal of finite subsets of <m>A</m>. This is where the notion of domain is helpful: the domain of <m>\Fin(\omega)</m> will remain <m>\omega</m>, even if we decide for some reason to view it as an ideal on a larger set.

<!-- div attr= class="example"-->
		<p>
			 Suppose <m>A</m> is a non-empty set and <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is the collection of ideals on <m>A</m> ordered by inclusion. Since the increasing union of a sequence of ideals is again an ideal on <m>A</m>, we know there are ideals on <m>A</m> that are maximal, in the sense that they are not properly contained in any other ideal. Such maximal ideals are called <em>prime ideals</em>, and their dual filters (which are also maximal elements of a suitable partial order) are called <em>ultrafilters</em>. If <m>I</m> is a prime ideal then <m>I^+</m> and <m>I^*</m> coincide, so a set is in <m>I</m> if and only if its complement is not. This means that for <m>X\in I^+=I^*</m> we have <m>I\restr X = I</m>, and if <m>A\setminus X</m> is in <m>I</m> then <m>I+X=I</m> as well.
