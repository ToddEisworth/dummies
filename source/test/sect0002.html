<p> Suppose that \(\overline\kappa =\langle \kappa _{n}\mid n\in \omega \rangle \) is a sequence of regular, uncountable cardinals, and consider the partially ordered product \((\prod _n \kappa _{n},{\lt})\), where \(f{\lt}g\) iff \(f(n){\lt}g(n)\) for all \(n\in \omega \). Let \(A=\ran (\overline\kappa )\). So \(A\) is a countable, perhaps finite, set of regular cardinals (that is, without repetitions). A very simple and useful fact in PCF theory is the fact that \((\prod _{m}\kappa _{n},{\lt})\) and \((\prod A,{\lt})\) have the same cofinality. Rudin herself used this fact in her nornality proof in <span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="sect0003.html#rudin" >10</a>
	]
</span>. This can easily be remembered as “one regular uncountale cardinal or the product of countably many copies of it have the same cofinality”. </p>
<p>For two functions \(f,g\) from \(\omega \) to the ordinals let us denote by \((f,g]\) the set of all functions \(h\) from \(\omega \) to the ordinals for which \(f{\lt}h\le g\). </p>

<p>It is readily seen that Rudin’s Dowker space is the space \(X(\aleph _{0},\langle \aleph _{{n+1}}\mid n\in \omega \rangle )\). </p>

Clearly, \(\langle D_n\mid n\in \omega \rangle \) is a decreasing and vanishing sequence of closed subsets of \(X(\mu ,\overline D)\).

<p>We proceed to prove that \(X(\mu ,\overline\kappa )\) is collectionwise normal. Suppose \(\mathcal H\) is a nonempty collection of pairwise disjoint (closed) subsets of \(X\) and for every \(\mathcal J\subseteq \mathcal H\) the union \(\bigcup \mathcal J\) is closed. We need to produce a family of pairwise disjoint open sets \(\{ U_D\mid D\in \mathcal H\} \) which separates \(\mathcal H\), that is, \(D\subseteq U_{D}\) for all \(D\in \mathcal H\). Let \(H=\bigcup \mathcal H\). </p>
<p>We define a tree \((T,\supseteq )\) of height \(\omega _{1}\). The nodes of the tree are open subsets of \(X\) and the tree order is reverse inclusion. </p>
<p>For every open set \(U\subseteq X\) let \(t_{U}\) be the supremum of \(U\). Clearly, if \(V\subseteq U\subseteq X\) then \(t_{V}\le t_{U}\). </p>

  <p>There exists a tree \((T,\supseteq )\) of height \(\omega _{1}\) with \(T\subseteq \tau \) whose tree order is reverse inclusion such that: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
  <li><p>For every \(\alpha {\lt}\omega _{1}\) the \(\alpha \)-th level of the tree, \(T_{\alpha }\), is a pairwise disjoint open cover of \(H\). </p>

</li>

  </div>
</div> </p>
<p>Suppose first that\((T,\supseteq )\) is a tree that satisfies the conditions above. For every \(h\in H\) and \(\alpha {\lt}\omega _{1}\), as \(T_{\alpha }\) is a pairwise disjoint cover of \(H\), there is a unique node \(U_{h,\alpha }\in T_{\alpha }\) to which \(h\) belongs, and \(\{ u_{h,\alpha }\mid \alpha {\lt}\omega _{1}\} \) is a branch of \(T\) all of whose members are nonempty open sets. If \(\alpha {\lt}\beta {\lt}\omega _{1}\) then \(U_{h,\alpha }\supseteq U_{h,\beta }\) and hence \(t_{U_{h,\beta }}\le t_{U_{h,\alpha }}\). There are no \(\lneqq \)-sequences of length \(\omega _{1}\) of functions from \(\mathbb N\) to the ordinals, thus, by condition (2), there is some ordinal \(\alpha (h){\lt}\omega _{1}\) such that \(t_{U_{h,\alpha (h)}}=t_{U_{h,\beta }}\) for all \(\alpha (h)\le \beta {\lt}\omega _{1}\). But now, by (2), \(U_{h,\alpha (h)}\) meets exactly one member of \(\mathcal H\) — namely, the member to which \(h\) belongs. </p>
<p>For every \(D\in \mathcal H\) let \(U(D)=\bigcup \{ U_{h,\alpha (h)}\mid h\in D\} \). This set is open as a union of open sets and covers \(D\). Let \(D_{0},D_{1}\in \mathcal H\) be distinct, hence disjoint, and let \(h_{0}\in D_{0}\) and \(h_1\in D_{1}\) be arbitrary. Let \(\beta =\max \{ \alpha (h_{0}),\alpha (h_{1})\} \). It holds that \(U_{h_{0},\alpha (h_{0})}=U_{h_{0},\beta }\) and \(U_{h_{1},\alpha (h_{1})}=U_{h_{1},\beta }\). As \(h_{0}\in U_{h_{0},\beta }\setminus U_{h_{1},\beta }\) these set are different, and because \(T_{\beta }\) is pairwise disjoint, are also disjoint. So \(U_{h_0,\alpha (h_{0})}\cap U_{h_1,\alpha (h_{1})}=\emptyset \). This shows that \(\{ U(D)\mid D\in \mathcal H \} \) is a family of pairwise disjoint open sets which separates \(\mathcal H\), and establishes the collectionwise normality of \(X\). </p>
<p>We prove now the claim by constructing the levels \(T_{\alpha }\) of \(T\) by induction on \(\alpha {\lt}\omega _{1}\). \(T_{0}=\{ X\} \). Suppose now \(0{\lt}\alpha {\lt}\omega _{1}\) and that \(T_{\beta }\) is defined for all \(\beta {\lt}\alpha \) such that conditions (1)–(2) hold for \(\bigcup _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }T_{\beta }\). </p>
<p>Suppose \(\alpha \) is a nonzero limit ordinal. For every \(h\in H\) and \(\beta {\lt}\alpha \) there is a unique \(U_{h,\beta }\in T_{\beta }\) to which \(h\) belongs. Let \(T_{\alpha }=\{ \bigcap _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }U_{h,\beta }\mid h\in H\} \). Every member of \(T_{\alpha }\) is open as a countable intersection of open sets. \(T_{\alpha }\) covers \(H\). Finally, if \(\bigcap _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }U_{h_{0},\beta }\) and \(\bigcap _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }U_{h_{1},\beta }\) are different there is some \(\gamma {\lt}\alpha \) for which \(U_{h_{0},\gamma }\not=U_{h_{1},\gamma }\) and as \(T_{\gamma }\) is pairwise disjoint, these sets are disjoint and so are \(\bigcap _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }U_{h_{0},\beta }\) and \(\bigcap _{\beta {\lt}\alpha }U_{h_{1},\beta }\). Conditions (1)-(2) hold easily in this case. </p>
<p>Assume now that \(\alpha =\beta +1\). Let \(U\in T_\beta \) be given. We define the set of immediate successors of \(U\) in \(T_{\alpha }\) to be a pairwise disjoint family \(J_{u}\) of open subsets of \(U\) which forms a cover of \(H\cap U\) and such that every \(V\in J_{u}\) either meets at most one element of \(H\) or else \(t_{V}\not=t_{U}\). Then let \(T_{\alpha }=\bigcup _{U\in T_{\beta }}J_{U}\) and all conditions hold easily. </p>
<p>If \(U\) meets at most one member of \(\mathcal H\) let \(J_{U}=\{ U\} \). </p>
<p>Suppose that \(U\) meets more than one member of \(\mathcal H\). In particular, \(U\not=\emptyset \). This implies that for every \(i\in \mathbb N\) the ordinal \(t_{U}(i)\) is a supremum of a nonempty set of limit ordinals, so is itself a non-zero limit ordinal. </p>
<p>Now divide the proof to two cases. </p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Case 1</b>: there is some \(i\in \mathbb N\) for which \(\cf (t_{U}(i))\le \mu \). Fix such an \(i\). Fix an increasing and continuous sequence \(\langle \gamma _{\delta }\mid \delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i)\rangle \) with \(\gamma _{0}=0\) which is cofinal in \(t_{U}(i)\). Let \(U_{\delta }=\{ h\in U\mid \gamma _{\delta }{\lt}h(i)\le \gamma _{\delta +1}\} \). There is no \(h\in X\) for which \(h(i)=t_{U}(i)\) and as \(\cf (\gamma _{\delta }){\lt} \mu \) for every limit \(\delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i))\), there is no \(h\in X\) for which \(h(i)=\gamma _{\delta }\) for some limit \(\delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i))\). Thus for every \(h\in U\) we have that \(\sup \{ \gamma _{\delta }\mid \delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i)\, \& \, \gamma _{\delta }{\lt}h(i))\} {\lt}h(i)\) so for every \(h\in U\) there is some \(\delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i))\) such that \(\gamma _{\delta }{\lt}h(i)\le \gamma _{\delta +1}\). </p>
<p>Let \(V_{\delta }=\{ h\in U\mid \gamma _{\delta }{\lt}h(i)\le \gamma _{\delta +1}\} \). The family of sets \(J_{U}=\{ V_{\delta }\mid \delta {\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i))\} \) is pairwise disjoint, its union is \(U\) and also each \(U_{\delta }\) is open. Finally, \(\sup \{ h(i)\mid h\in V_{\delta }\} \le \gamma _{\delta +1}{\lt}t_{U}(i)\), hence \(t_{V_{\delta }}\not=t_{u}\), for every \(\delta {\lt}\cf (T_{U}(i))\). Thus \(J_{U}\) is as required. </p>

  \[ V_{M}=\{ f\in U\mid \mathord {\le } (f,h)=M\} . \]

<p>Each \(V_{M}\) is an open subset of \(U\) and \(M_{0}\not=M_{1}\) implies \(V_{M_{0}}\cap V_{M_{1}}=\emptyset \). Also, \(U=\bigcup \{ V_M\mid M\subseteq \mathbb N\} \). </p>
<p>If \(M\not=\emptyset \) fix some \(i\in M\) and then \(f(i)\le h(i){\lt}t_U(i)\) for all \(f\in V_{M}\), so \(t_{V_M}(i){\lt}t_{U}(i)\) and therefore \(t_{V_{M}}\not=t_{U}\). </p>
<p>Thus, if \(t_{{V_{M}}}=t_{U}\) then necessarily \(M=\emptyset \) and then \(V_{\emptyset }=U\cap (h,t_{U}]\), (and also \(V_{\emptyset }\not=\emptyset \)), which by the claim meets at most one member of \(\mathcal H\). So letting \(J_{U}=\{ V_{M}\mid M\subseteq \mathbb N\} \) we are done. </p>
<p>So we turn to the proof of the Claim <a href="sect0002.html#aux">2.2.3</a>. </p>
<p>For each \(n\in \mathbb N\) let \(U_{n}=\{ f\in U\mid (\forall _{i\in \mathbb N})\, \cf (f(i))\le \kappa _{n}\} \). By the definition of \(X\) it follows that \(m{\lt}n\Rightarrow U_m\subseteq U_n\) and that \(U=\bigcup _{n}U_{n}\). </p>
<p>It will suffice, then, to find, for each \(n\in \mathbb N\), a function \(h_{n}{\lt}t_{U}\) such that \(U_{n}\cap (h_{n},t_{U}]\) meets at most one member of \(\mathcal H\), for then \(h=\sup \{ h_{n}\mid n\in \mathbb N\} {\lt}t_{U}\) is as required. </p>

<p>Let \(k\in U_{n}\) be arbitrary and let \(i\in B\) be given. As \(U_{n}\subseteq U\) and \(t_{U}=\sup (U)\) it holds that \(k\le t_{U}\), so in particular \(k(i)\le t_{U}(i)\). But as \(\cf (k(i))\le \kappa _{n}{\lt}\cf (t_{U}(i))\), it necessarily holds that \(k(i){\lt}t_{U(i)}\). Thus: </p>

In case \(\alpha =\beta +1\) let \(k_{\alpha }\) be an element of \(\{ k,k'\} \) which does not belong to the same elenent of \(\mathcal H\) to which \(k_{\beta }\) belongs. As \(k\) and \(k'\) are from different elements of \(\mathcal H\), at least one of them is not in the same \(D\in \mathcal H\) as \(k_{\beta }\) is. If \(\alpha \) is limit or \(0\), let \(k_{\alpha }=k\). Thus conditions (1)–(4) of the induction are satisfied. </p>
<p>Now that the induction is done, put \(k=(t_{U}\restriction A)\cup (\sup \{ k_{\alpha }\mid \alpha {\lt}\kappa _{n}\} \restriction B)\). By (3), for every \(i\in B\) the value \(k(i)\) is a limit of a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals of length \(\kappa _{n}\), so \(\cf (k(i))=\kappa _{n}\) for all \(i\in B\) (and therefore \(k{\lt}(t_{U}\restriction B)\)). Furthermore, for every \(\ell \in \prod _{{i\in B}}k(i)\) there is some  \(\alpha {\lt}\kappa _n\) such that \(\ell {\lt}k_\beta \) for all \(\alpha \le \beta {\lt}\kappa _n\) by the standard “rectangle argument". </p>
<p>For \(i\in A\) it holds that \(k(i)=t_U(i)\), so by the assumptions on \(t_{U}\) and the definition of \(A\) it holds that \(\mu {\lt}\cf (k(i))\le \kappa _{n}\). So \(\mu {\lt}\cf (k(i))\le \kappa _{n}\) for all \(i\in \mathbb N\). This confirms that \(k\in X\). Suppose that \(\ell {\lt}k\) is given, namely, that \((\ell ,k]\) is some basic open neighborhood of \(k\). There is some \(\alpha {\lt}\kappa _n\) such that \((\ell \restriction B){\lt}k_{\beta }\) for all \(\alpha {\lt}\beta {\lt}\kappa _n\). For a cofinal set of indices \(\beta {\lt}\kappa _n\) it holds that \((\ell \restriction A){\lt}q_{\beta +n}\) for all \(n\in \omega \) by our choice of \(\langle q_{\alpha }\mid \alpha {\lt}\kappa _n\rangle \) and condition (2) of the induction. If \(\beta {\gt}\alpha _{0}\) is any one of these indices it holds that \(k_{\beta +n}\in (\ell ,k]\) for all \(n\). As \((\ell ,k]\) is an arbitrary basic open neighborhood of \(k\) and \(k_{\alpha }\in H\) for all \(\alpha \), it follows that \(k\in \cl (\{ k_{\alpha }\mid \alpha {\lt}\kappa _n\} )\), in fact, that \(k\) is in the closure of every final segment of \(\langle k_{\alpha }\mid \alpha {\lt}\kappa _n\rangle \). As \(k_{\alpha }\in H\) for all \(\alpha \) and \(H\) is closed, \(k\in H\). Let \(D\in \mathcal H\) be the unique member of \(\mathcal H\) to which \(k\) belongs. Now for every open neighborhood of \(k\) there is some \(\beta {\lt}\kappa _n\) such that both \(k_{\beta }\) and \(k_{\beta +1}\) are in this neighborhood. Since these elements belong to different members of \(\mathcal H\), at least one of them is not a member of \(D\). This shows that \(k\) belongs to \(\cl (H\setminus D)\) which is a contradiction, as \(H\setminus D\) is closed and disjoint of \(D\). <div class="proof_wrapper" id="a0000000019">

<p>Examples of parameters \(\mu \) and \(\overline\kappa \) which satisfy the condition the main theorem in \(\zfc \) are ample. For every cardinal \(\mu \), the sequence of \(\langle \mu ^{n+1}\mid n\in \omega \rangle \) satisfies the condition, because in the interval \((\mu ,\mu ^{n+1}\) there are just finitely many cardinals. Also, if \(\overline\kappa \) is taken to be an increasing sequence of successors of strong limit singulars of uncountable cofinality, then condition holds again, but this time the sequences can be taken to be arbitrarily sparce, that is, with arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive members of the sequence. </p>
<p>It is natural to ask if it is possible that <em>all</em> sequences of regular cardinals above some \(\mu \) satisfy the condition, and hence \(X(\mu ,\overline\kappa \) is Dowker. Mild restrictions on cardinal arithmetic give this. Certainly the \(\gch \), or the weaker \(\sch \) or even a weaker axiom, imply this:  <div class="theorem_thmwrapper " id="a0000000020">

</div> Suppose \(\mu \) and \(\overline\kappa \) are given. It suffices to prove that for every \(n\in \omega \) and every countable \(A\subseteq \Reg \cap (\mu ,\kappa _{n}]\) it holds that \(\cf (\prod A,{\lt})\le \kappa _{n}\). By removing a final end-segment of \(A\), if necessary, we can assume that \(A\) has no last element. If \(A\) is empty there is little to prove, so assume that \(A\) is an infinite, countable set of regular cardinals. Let \(\lambda =\sup A\). So \(\lambda \) is a singular cardinal of cofinality \(\omega \) and necessarily \(\lambda {\lt}\kappa _{n}\). As we have assumed \(\ssh \), we know that \(pp \lambda =\lambda ^{+}\le \kappa _{n}\) and as by a basic PCF theorem, \(\cf (\prod A,{\lt})=\max (\pcf (A))\), we conclude that \(\cf (\prod A,{\lt})\le \kappa _{n}\), as required. <div class="proof_wrapper" id="a0000000022">

<p>In Rudin’s space the local weight at each point of the space is one of the \(\aleph _{n}\)-s for \(n{\gt}0\). In the generalized \(X(\mu ,\overline\kappa )\) is is possible to get as many different local weights as one wants by a suitable choice of the parameters. Suppose that \(\overline\kappa \) is an increasing sequence of regular cardinals, each closed under the \(pp\) function at singularls of countable cofinality. Such a sequence can be choses as sparse as one wants. In the resulting space there will be points of local weight \(\theta \) for every regular \(\theta \) in the interval \((\mu ,\sup (\overline\kappa ))\). </p>
<p>Let us finally remark that in Definition <a href="sect0002.html#def">2.1</a> it is not necessary to assume that \(\overline\kappa \) is increasing. It suffices to that it does not have a largest term. That is, the sequence contain repetitions. The same results hold also in this slighly more general setting. </p>
