  <title>Ordinal-valued functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> This chapter focuses on the most basic objects of pcf theory: the class <m>\On^A</m> 
      of functions that map an infinite set <m>A</m> into the ordinals, together with the relations that 
      arise from comparing these functions modulo an ideal (or filter) on <m>A</m>.  Our main goal is to develop vocabulary and a basic toolbox that 
      will support the deeper investigations in later chapters.
