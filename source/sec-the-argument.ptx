  <title><em>THE</em> argument</title>

  <p> Our goal in this section is to lay out some variants of the key argument that ties characteristic functions of models to their contents.</p>



  <p>
    Our usual assumption is that <m>\lambda</m> is a singular cardinal, and <m>\chi </m> is a regular cardinal must larger than <m>\lambda</m>.  We let <m>\mathfrak{A}</m> denote
    the structure <m>\langle H(\chi), \in, \lt_\chi\rangle</m> where as usual <m>H(\chi)</m> denotes the sets hereditarily of cardinality less than <m>\chi </m> and <m>\lt_\chi</m> is some 
    fixed well-ordering of <m>H(\chi)</m> which is included to ensure that we have definable Skolem functions in the structure <m>\mathfrak{A}</m>.
  </p>


  <theorem xml:id="thm-">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Assume <m>\mu\lt\lambda</m> and <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> are elementary submodels of <m>\mathfrak{A}</m> such that 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\lambda\in M\cap N</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>N\cap\mu\subseteq M\cap\mu</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>N\cap\mu</m> is a (possibly improper) initial segment of <m>\mu</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>M\cap\theta</m> contains a cofinal subset of <m>N\cap\theta</m> for each regular cardinal <m>\theta</m> in <m>M\cap N\cap (\mu,\lambda]</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Then <m>N\cap\lambda\subseteq M</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
     Given such models note that the hypotheses are still satisfied if we replace <m>M</m> with the smaller model <m>M\cap N</m>, so without loss of generality we can assume
     <m>M\subseteq N</m>.  Now assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap\lambda\setminus M</m> is non-empty, and define
      <me>
        \alpha :=\min(N\cap\lambda\setminus M)
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \beta:=\min(M\setminus\alpha).
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
    Since <m>\alpha\lt\beta</m>  and <m>M\cap [\alpha,\beta)=\emptyset</m> we know that <m>\beta</m> must be a limit ordinal, and since in addition <m>\alpha\in N\cap\theta</m> our assumptions imply 
    that <m>\beta</m> cannot be a regular cardinal.  The ordinal <m>\beta</m> is in <m>M</m>, so we will have available in that model the cardinal <m>\cf(\beta)</m> as well as a strictly increasing
    function <m>f</m> from <m>\cf(\beta)</m> onto a cofinal subset of <m>\beta</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because <m>M\cap [\alpha,\beta)=\emptyset</m> we know that <m>\cf(\beta)\lt \alpha</m>, and so by our choice of <m>\alpha</m> we are guaranteed that 
    <me>
      M\cap\cf(\beta)=N\cap\cf(\beta)
    </me>
    The ordinal <m>\alpha</m> is available in <m>N</m> along with <m>f</m>, and so <m>N</m> will contain an ordinal <m>\gamma\lt\cf(\beta)</m> with
    <me>
    \alpha\lt f(\gamma)\lt\beta.
    </me>
    Since <m>M\cap\cf(\beta)=N\cap\cf(\beta)</m> it follows that <m>\gamma</m> and <m>f(\gamma)</m> are also both in <m>M</m>, and this contradicts...
